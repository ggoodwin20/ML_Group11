Group Homework 1
Rewrite KNN sample code using KNeighborsClassifier.
Repeat KNN for each k (from 1 to 20), for at least five times and calculate average accuracy to be your result.
If you use the latest version of scikit-learn, you need to program with Python>=3.5.
Use the same dataset: “iris data”
Draw a line chart (recorded video): Use a “for loop” to change k from 1 to 20 and check your model accuracy.

Quick Start about steps and things TA and I need to know to run your code or Jupyter notebook, e.g. dependencies…
Which K (from 1 to 20) works the best? If all Ks have similar accuracy, please write down your thoughts about “Why.”
